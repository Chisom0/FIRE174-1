<h1>FIRE174</h1>

This repository provides a skeletal template for students enrolled in FIRE174-0101, an immersive research experience at the University of Maryland, College Park. Directed by Dr. Jessica H. Lu, students are exploring the intersections of African American rhetorical history, archives, and Black digital humanities to identify, collect, preserve, and analyze FREEDOM discourse, as constituted and argued by Black users online, using the <a href="http://tei-c.org">TEI</a> standard of scholarly markup. This project is currently advanced by: Lisa Anoruo, Nicole Balay, Menna Ibrahim, Hadley McCarthy, Cheyenne Montgomery, Chisom Okeke, Yasmine Pierre, Jasmin Pineda, Shanice Silva, Me'Aziah Wilson, and Nahome Yeshitila. Project alumni include Sophia Crooks, Kayla Graham, Kaanita Iyer, Ariana Lawson, Alice Liu, and Courtney Richardson.

THIS RESEARCH <b>VALUES</b>:
1. The agency and empowerment of Black people and their voices
2. The historically innovative language practices of African Americans
3. The intellectual, physical, and emotional labor of Black rhetors, and those who endeavor to amplify and analyze their contributions to public discourse
4. The vital role of archives, both traditional and digital, in constituting and disrupting human histories and public morality
5. The power of archives to make meaning of human pasts, presents, and futures

THIS RESEARCH <b>AIMS</b> TO:
1. Identify, collect, preserve, and analyze freedom discourse, as constituted and argued by Black users online
2. Extend understandings of African Americans' rhetorical history, especially concerning conceptions of FREEDOM, and their use of language to disrupt and resist anti-Black logics
3. Affirm and analyze Black people's creative use of digital spaces to innovate human language practices
4. Cultivate productive and healthy workflows and research habits
5. Offer transparent and accessible educational materials, enriched by critical theory and concepts, to public audiences

This project is made possible by the support of the African American History, Culture, & Digital Humanities (AADHum) initiative, the First-Year Innovation and Research Experience (FIRE), and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park.
